## 我的第七次作业
1、Program with machine language according to the following c.
<br/>int_8 a = 1;
<br/>int_8 c = a + 3;
<br/>1）Write your assembly code & machine code
<br/>assembly code:
<br/>LOD #1
<br/>STO W
<br/>ADD #3
<br/>STO X
<br/>HLT
<br/>machine code:
<br/>00010100 00000001
<br/>00000101 10000000
<br/>00010100 00000011
<br/>00000101 10000001
<br/>00001111 00000000
<br/>2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle 
<br/>从内存中提取指令-->将指令放入IR中并解码,执行,结果存入ACC-->PC指向下一条即将执行的指令-->提取指令-->······(循环)
<br/>3）Explain functions about IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU
<br/>IR:储存刚从内存中取出的指令
<br/>PC:指向下一个即将执行的指令
<br/>ACC:暂存一个计算结果
<br/>4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine
<br/>a和c是数据的存储位置
<br/>2、简答题
<br/>1）What are stored in memory?
<br/>指令和数据(二进制串)
<br/>2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place?
<br/>可以
<br/>3）Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.
<br/>LOD #1 的机器语言为00010100 00000001,其中前8位00010100为指令,第四位是寻址模式,为1时表示操作数是数值,为0时表示操作数是该地址的内容,后4位为操作码.后8位是操作数,指一个数值或者一个内存地址.
<br/>3、解释以下词汇
<br/>1）**汇编语言(Assembly Language)**
<br/>An assembly (or assembler) language,often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.
<br/>2）**编译（Compiler）**
<br/>A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.
<br/>3）**命令式语言（Imperative programming）**
<br/>In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. 
<br/>4）**函数编程语言（Functional programming）**
<br/>In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.
<br/>5）**过程式编程（Procedural programming）**
<br/>Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
