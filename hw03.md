## 我的第三次作业
# Write out variables x, y and z in binary code
1. int8_t x=67; int8_t y=-7; int8_t z=y-x;
**x=01000011**；**y=11111001**；**z=10110110**;
2. int8_t x=0xd3;  
**x=11010011**;**(溢出错误)**
3. uint8_t x=0xd3;  
**x=11010011**;
4. int8_t x=127; int8_t y=-7; int8_t z=y–x;
**x=01111111**; **y=11111001**;**z=101111010(溢出错误)**;
5. float x=1.125;  
**x=1.001000**;
6. float x=23.0;  
**x=10111.000000**;
7. float x=0.45;  
**x=0.011100(精度误差)**；


# 使用维基百科解释以下概念
1. **Method of complements**:In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique used to subtract one number from another using only addition of positive numbers.

2. **Byte**:The byte is a unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits, representing a binary number. 

3. **Integer (computer science)**:In computer science, an integer is a datum of integral data type, a data type that represents some range of mathematical integers.

4. **Floating point**:In computing, floating-point arithmetic (FP) is arithmetic using formulaic representation of real numbers as an approximation so as to support a trade-off between range and precision.
